        <big><b>What is this app?</b></big>
        <br/>This is a music player that I wrote for myself, in accordance with my vision of how a music player should look like.
        <br/>If you find an error, %1$s about it.
        <br/>If you feel that some features are missing, %1$s about it, but I can\'t promise that I necessarily implement it. Usually I do after a while.
        <br/>
        <br/><big><b>Is this app completely free?</b></big>
        <br/>Yes, no ads, no in-app purchases. Perhaps if this app becomes highly popular I could implement some paid non-essential features, but I definitely won\'t add ads or lock existing functionality.
        <br/>
        <br/><big><b>Has this app any analytics or data collection?</b></big>
        <br/>No analytics or something else. This app even hasn\'t internet connection permission. (At least until implementation features that requires internet connection.) %2$s.
        <br/>

        <br/><big><b>Where is habitual for music players big cover screen?</b></big>
        <br/>High amount of similar looking apps with big covers screens was one of the main reason for creation this app. I don\'t like big cover, it just takes screen space. Let there be current play queue in this place.
        <br/>
        <br/><big><b>Where are repeat/shuffle buttons?</b></big>
