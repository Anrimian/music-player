        <br/>This is a music player that I wrote for myself, in accordance with my vision of how a music player should look like.
        <br/>If you find an error, %1$s about it.
        <br/>If you feel that some features are missing, %1$s about it, but I can\'t promise that I necessarily implement it. Usually I do after a while.
        <br/>
        <br/><big><b>Is this app completely free?</b></big>
        <br/>Yes, no ads, no in-app purchases. Perhaps if this app becomes highly popular I could implement some paid non-essential features, but I definitely won\'t add ads or lock existing functionality.
        <br/>
        <br/><big><b>Has this app any analytics or data collection?</b></big>
        <br/>No analytics or something else. This app even hasn\'t internet connection permission. (At least until implementation features that requires internet connection.)
        <br/>
        <br/><big><b>Translations</b></big>
        <br/>If you find an error in app texts or want to offer translation to your language, %2$s about it.]]>
